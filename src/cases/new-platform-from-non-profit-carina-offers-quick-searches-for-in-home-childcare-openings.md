Tens of thousands of BIPOC and immigrant women who provide childcare and homecare around the U.S. use [Carina.org](http://carina.org/) to connect with parents and patients who need them. Percussion Strategic’s team took Carina’s marketing to the next level by creating, testing, tracking, and optimizing hundreds of messages, landing pages, videos, digital ads, and other tools to increase Carina’s lead generation and conversion rates over a two year period.
