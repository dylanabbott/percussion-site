Percussion Strategic took **AFSCME 2428’s** contract fight from 0 to 100 decibels, quickly creating a new [public-facing campaign](http://eastbayparkworker.org/) with an eye catching logo, website, action platform, emotion-driven digital ads, earned and social media to generate thousands of personal messages to decision makers.
