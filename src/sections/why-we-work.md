Our core values are:

**Driven by your mission:** You deserve consultants who care about the work just as much as you do.

**Stand by our work**: If we aren’t meeting your goals, we’ll be the first to call it out and fix it.

**Pro-BIPOC, pro-gay, pro-trans, pro-woman:** We believe in making space and generating demand for other women, BIPOC, and LGBTQ creative and campaign freelancers. We are building an anti-racist work space.

**Take smart risks, make smart mistakes**: We are always studying and testing, trying out new strategies and tactics.

**Empathy & ethics:** We are firm believers in [ethical storytelling](https://www.ethicalstorytelling.com/), providing campaign messengers with the emotional and financial support they need to share their experiences.

**Humor & humility:** It’s not about us, it’s about you, and forwarding your mission.
