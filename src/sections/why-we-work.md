Our core values are:

**Driven by YOUR mission:** We only work with clients we respect, and on issues we agree with. You deserve consultants who care about the work just as much as you do.

**Stand by our work**: We work hard, and we work smart. We are data geeks, we love metrics, spreadsheets, and deliverables. If we aren’t meeting your goals, we’ll be the first to call it out and fix it.

**Pro-BIPOC, pro-gay, pro-trans, pro-woman:** We believe in making space and generating demand for other women, BIPOC, and LGBTQ creative and campaign consultants. We work to make sure that Black Lives Matter and we are anti-racist. We believe in power with, not power over, each other. We incorporate the [Race Class Narrative](https://www.demos.org/campaign/race-class-narrative-project) into our messaging whenever possible.

**Take smart risks, make smart mistakes**: We are always studying and testing, trying out new strategies and tactics. We’re okay with making, owning, and sharing the learnings from our mistakes.

**Empathy & ethics:** We listen, see, and feel our clients’ points of view. And we are firm believers in [ethical storytelling](https://www.ethicalstorytelling.com/), providing campaign messengers with the emotional and financial support they need to share their experiences.

**Humor & humility:** Look, we see our place in the system. It’s not about us, it’s about you, and forwarding your mission. We collaborate with you, and with each other, to bring about the best results and have fun while doing it.
