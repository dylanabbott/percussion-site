title: Who We Are

---
We are a women-led syndicate of professional creative, communications, and campaign consultants servicing progressive campaigns and organizations. Most of us are LGBTQ.

We call ourselves a syndicate because we are fast and lean. There’s no overhead, no hidden costs, no figurehead partners padding bills.

Each of us is an independent contractor. We choose to work together because, well, we like each other, and respect each other’s expertise and track record of positive impact.

Here’s another way of looking at it: We’re each solo musicians who jam together and make amazing music.

As campaign professionals, we have each served dozens of progressive clients including labor unions, coalitions, service organizations, ballot initiative campaigns, environmental groups, Democratic candidates, and many more.

Looking for a specific skill set or just one service? Contact any one of us.
